# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis in Washington State

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the population of electric vehicles (EVs) across five selected cities in Washington state: Seattle, Kent, Yakima, Zillah, and Olympia. The goal is to understand the distribution of EVs by city and to categorize them by manufacturer, including Tesla, BMW, Toyota, Nissan, and Ford. Additionally, the analysis distinguishes between Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

## Data Preparation

Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and reliability. This cleaning process involved:

- **Removing Duplicate Entries**: Ensuring each record is unique.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Addressing any missing or incomplete data.
- **Standardizing Data Formats**: Ensuring consistency in data formats across different fields.

## Data Analysis

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using Google BigQuery. Key metrics include:

- **Total EV Count**: Number of EVs in each city.
- **Manufacturer Breakdown**: Counts of EVs by manufacturer (Tesla, BMW, Toyota, Nissan, Ford).
- **Vehicle Type Breakdown**: Counts of BEVs and PHEVs.

## Visualization

The results of the analysis are visualized in a Tableau dashboard. The dashboard includes:

- **City-wise EV Distribution**: Bar charts displaying the total number of EVs for each city.
- **Manufacturer Breakdown**: Pie charts or bar charts showing the distribution of EVs by manufacturer.
- **Vehicle Type Breakdown**: Charts showing the distribution of BEVs and PHEVs.

## Insights

This analysis is particularly useful for those looking to establish EV charging stations in Washington state. By understanding which cities have higher EV populations and the prevalent EV makes in each city, stakeholders can make informed decisions on optimal locations for charging infrastructure. The study highlights key trends in EV distribution and provides valuable data for planning and development efforts.
